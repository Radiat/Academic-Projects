  There are 17 tests in the makefile. A reminder of what is
  expected is provided in the output but it is more fully discussed here:

  Note: some of the expected test results refer to number of days -
  displaying days was not a specified requirement, so no marks
  are deducted if accurate data points are reported instead. 
  However, if days are reported, the accuracy of the number of 
  days is marked.

  The first 6 tests (0-5) cover incorrect commandline arguments. In each case 
  the problem should be reported to standard error and the program should
  stop. Each test is worth 3 marks and is marked as follows:
    1 mark: message is useful (either explains problem or provides usage)
    1 mark: message sent to standard error (not to standard output)
    1 mark: program stops so we don't get any messages about averages
  The output shows both standard error and standard output so if the student
  incorrectly directs the messages consistently but has everything else 
  correct, they will get 12/18 on these 6 tests.

  Special Note for Test 5: This test covers the behaviour when the specified
  start date is after the specified finish date. The correct behaviour is 
  EITHER to report the problem to standard error and stop writing nothing
  to standard out OR to report the fact to standard out that the date range 
  contains no valid measurements and so no average could be calculated.  

  The next 4 tests (6-9) cover the default values for arguments. Again each
  is worth 3 points broken down as follows:

   test 6:  reports duration of 908 days for 3 marks  
            (907 or 909 would get 1 mark)
            no marks added or deducted for temp value or reporting it is temp

   test 7:  3 marks, one each for:
               4 days duration
               *temperature*   is measurement of interest
               average is about 8.2

   test 8:  3 marks, one each for:
               28 days duration
               *temperature*  is measurement of interest
               average is about 14

   test 9:  3 marks for no output from diff

   The next three tests are concerned with getting the correct average when
   the measurements come from within the same data file. They are
   all worth 4 marks (notice the difference) and broken down as follows:


  test 10:  2 marks for saying 7 days 
            2 marks for average of about 14

  test 11:  2 marks for saying precipitation
            2 marks for average of about 5.5

  test 12:  2 marks for saying humidity
            2 marks for average of about 98

The final 4 tests (13-16) are also worth 4 each as follows:

  test 13:  2 marks for saying 51 days
            2 marks for average of about -1

  test 14:  2 marks for saying 6 days
            2 marks for average of about 93

  test 15:  1 marks for saying 12 days
            1 marks for average of about 83
            2 marks for warning about the 'nd' value to standard err

  test 16:  2 marks for reporting that range contained no data
            1 mark for sending this message to standard out NOT standard err
            1 mark for not trying to calculate a value and crashing

There are also some points on implementation detail and style,
design, that may require deductions from the total.
