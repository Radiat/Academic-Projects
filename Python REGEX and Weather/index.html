    <h1>CSC207H/B07H Software Design: Exercise 3</h1>

    <h2>Part 0: Learning Regular Expressions</h2>

    <p>
      There is no required software to download or install for this
      assignment but you might want to install <a
      href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/">the regex-coach</a>. This
      graphical application (for Windows or Linux) can be used 
      to experiment with regular expressions that are needed in some 
      of the programs below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good resource for reading about regular expressions is the
      <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/">Regular Expression
      HOWTO</a> by A.M.Kuchling.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1: A Regular Expression Exercise</h2>
      <p> 
        Here you need to write one file, "<code>regex.py</code>",
        containing five Python classes,
        <code>RE1</code>,
        <code>RE2</code>,
        <code>RE3</code>,
        <code>RE4</code> and
        <code>RE5</code>.
        Each class has methods
        <code>__init__()</code>,
        <code>search()</code> and
        <code>match()</code>; like the standard <code>search()</code> and
        <code>match()</code> for regular-expression objects in
        Python's <code>re</code> module, these ones take a 
        single parameter -- the string being matched or searched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some further characteristics of these methods should become
        clear from reading the class descriptions below, and the 
        <code>regexTest.py</code> file in your repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should use inheritance from a basic parent class to avoid
        repetition in the <code>RE<i>i</i></code> classes, and you 
        should also pass off all the pattern-matching work to Python's 
        <code>re</code> module. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this exercise is to write five regular expressions:
      </p>

      <ol>
          <li>
          <code>RE1</code> accepts strings consisting of one or more
          <code>b</code>s. The empty string is not accepted, and no characters
          other than <code>b</code> are allowed. The point here is to use a
          very easy regular expression to get your class structure right.
          </li>

          <li>
          <code>RE2</code> accepts strings that are empty or comment-only
          lines in a Python program. You might use this regular expression
          to count the non-empty lines in your code.
          Assume white space consists only of space characters, with no tabs.
          </li>

          <li>
          <code>RE3</code> accepts phone numbers in the slightly old-fashioned
          standard form, "(416) 555-1234", where the space after the area code
          is allowed but not required. The area code (in the example, the 416)
          and the exchange number (555) must not start with 0 or 1.
          In the match object returned by the
          <code>search()</code> and
          <code>match()</code> functions, the area code, the exchange number
          and the final four digits must all be in separate groups,
          so that the caller can use the <code>group(i)</code> method to
          retrieve the <code>i</code>th group.
          </li>

          <li>
          <code>RE4</code> accepts names in the
          form, "Funky L. Winkerbean", with any number of spaces between the
          parts of the name.
          The family name ("Winkerbean") may begin with "Mac" or "Mc" followed
          by a capital letter, but the given name ("Funky") may not.
          The given name must be at least two letters long, but the
          family name could be just one letter.
          The given name, initial, and family name must be returned 
          in separate groups.
          <em>Note:</em> As the test cases will suggest,
          your regular expression is free to accept some surprising
          names, and it may also reject names that in real life are
          perfectly acceptable,
          for example names containing apostrophes or hyphens.
          </li>

          <li>
          <code>RE5</code> is a messy but real example.
          The best way to start working on it is to look at the test cases,
          because they define the format of the input lines.
          The strings being matched are from a student data file,
          with one line per student.
          Each line contains data items such as
          family name, given name, student number,
          various registration codes, courses, etc.
          The fields are separated mostly by tabs but sometimes by spaces.
          The purpose of <code>RE5</code> is to
          extract the family name, the given name and the email address.
          They must be extractable from the match using
          <code>group('family')</code>,
          <code>group('given')</code> and
          <code>group('email')</code>, respectively.
          Please see the sample input for <code>RE5</code> in
          <code>regexTest.py </code> for the expected format of the
          lines.
          Your regular expression must match the entire line, and it must
          include each tab explicitly.
          </li>

      </ol>

      <p>
        As noted, a set of tests is provided in the file 
        <code>regexTest.py</code>.  Read the tests carefully, because 
        they will answer many of the questions left unanswered by the 
        descriptions above.
        You may well find that the tests show that your answers can be
        less restrictive than you'd been thinking.
      </p>

    <h2>Part 2: Weather Data Averages: A Practical Python Tool </h2>

    <p>
      The Geography department at UTM publishes its
      <a href = "http://eratos.erin.utoronto.ca/UTMMS/">meteorological station 
      data</a> on the web.
      You need to write a Python tool called <code>average_weather.py</code> to
      calculate various averages from this weather data over date ranges
      specified by the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Command-line Arguments</h3>
    <p>
      Your program interface must be as follows:
      <br/>
      <code>python average_weather.py -s date -e date -t -h -p
outputfile</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The flags <code>-s</code> and <code>-e</code> are both options which 
      require a date argument in the format <code>YYYY/MM/DD</code>. They
      indicate the start and end dates for the period over which the
      measurements should be averaged.
      The end points are included in the period.
      The non-parameterized options 
      <code>t,p,</code>and <code>h</code> indicate which measurement should
      be considered. They represent temperature, precipitation and
      humidity respectively. The options described thus far can be specified
      by the user in any order.  The final parameter is the name of an 
      output file.  The default behaviour for each option
      is: 
      <dl>
      <dt>start date</dt><dd>2003/11/01</dd>
      <dt>end date</dt><dd>2006/05/31</dd>
      <dt>if none of <code>-t</code>, <code>-p</code> or <code>-h</code> given
      </dt><dd>average temperature</dd>
      <dt>outputfile</dt><dd>output to standard output</dd>
      </dl> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of valid ways to call your program.
      <ul>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py</code></li>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py -h </code></li>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py -p precipation.out </code></li>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py -s 2003/07/14 -h -e 2005/03/12 </code></li>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py -w -e 2006/04/14 -s 2005/03/12 </code></li>
      <li><code>python average_weather.py -t -s 2003/11/09 &gt; my.output</code></li>
      </ul>
      In the last call the output from the program is sent to
      <em>stdout</em> and the system redirects this output to the file 
      <code>my.output</code>

    <h3>Reading files from the web</h3>
      <p> 
       Your program should read the data files from the web 
       using the Python <code>urllib</code> class. You may not download 
       the files ahead of time and then read them from a local copy.  You also
       can't afford to read all the files every time the program runs. Instead
       you must read only from files which might contain measurements for the
       period in which you are interested.  When you look at the data files
       you will discover that although the files are named by months, they
       do not correspond directly to all measurements for the named month. 
       They typically contain some data from the end of the previous 
       month. For example
       the <code>January06</code> file contains the data from December 21, 2005
       to partway through the day on January 31, 2006.
       Therefore, it is acceptable to read
       one extra file for each program run.
      </p>

    <h3>The File Format</h3>
     <p>
       Read the files and the UTMMS web site and figure it out yourself. 
       Don't look at files
       earlier than <code>november03.txt</code>
       Although the data for the previous
       years is available on the web and looks the same in your browser, it has
       different line endings. Take special note of the fact that for every 
       day there are two lines for the time <code>2400</code>. The first 
       contains the normal measurements at this time. The second line is a 
       day summary line. It includes daily averages for temperature and 
       humidity and the daily total for precipitation.
     </p>
     <p>
       One important thing to notice is that the date is stored as the Julian
       date. It isn't a true Julian date but instead considers 
       January 1st of that same year to be day 1. You will find the Python 
       <code>datetime</code> module very helpful here. 
     </p>

    <h3>Calculating Averages</h3>
     <!--p>
       Consider the following scenario. My daughter has a school project to
       measure and calculate the average temperature of our yard. She begins
       her project after school at 3 p.m. when it is quite warm outside. At
       first she is quite keen taking 10 measurements in the first hour. She
       writes each of these in her journal. Then between 4 and her 8 p.m. 
       bedtime her interest wanes but she still manages to get 4 more 
       measurements. Between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. the next morning she takes no
       readings and then gets one reading at 8 a.m., one at lunch and
       one at 3 p.m. the next day. She adds up these 17 values and divides
       by 17 to calculate the average daily temperature. You can see that
       her result will be much too high since it was so heavily biased towards
       the warmer after-school period. For a proper time average, the values
       must be weighted by the length of the intervals they represent. 
     </p-->

     <p>
       For this program, you are interested in daily averages for temperature
       and humidity and average daily total precipitation. You can use the
       summary <code>2400</code> line and ignore the hourly measurements.
       Occasionally there is a missing or incorrectly formatted value. Just
       omit that measurement from the average. 
     </p>

    <h3>Dealing with Errors </h3>
     <p>
       There are two sources of errors that your program must handle. 
       When the user calls the program in an invalid way such as
       providing an invalid date or an unknown flag, the program should
       print a helpful message to standard error and then quit. One thing
       to note is that we will not test your program with multiple valid
       flags. For example,
       we will not test <code>python average_weather -t -p -h
        </code>. In such a situation you may choose to exit with a message
        saying "choose only one option", you may choose to provide averages
        for multiple fields or you may choose some other behaviour.
     </p>
     <p>
       Another source of errors is the data files themselves. Some 
       days have no valid measurements. Check out January 04, 2004.
       Other days may have a data line but the field of interest might be
       blank or might contain a non-numeric value such as "nd" representing
       "no data". If the range specified by the user includes problematic
       values then send an appropriate warning message to standard error
       and omit these values from the calculation. Do not stop running but
       calculate an average with the valid measurements that you do have. Do
       not worry if it is no longer a correct time average.   Occasionally 
       the user might specify an entire range of dates for which you have no
       valid data. In that case your program must not crash but instead it 
       should
       print a helpful message to standard out explaining that an average 
       can not be calculated with no data. 
     </p>

    <h3>Some Other Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhere in your solution you must make use of the following 
        features of the Python programming language: 
        <ol>
         <li>
            Use the <code>getopt</code> module.
         </li>
         <li>
            Write (and then call) a method that returns multiple values. 
         </li>
         <li>
         You must call a method that has optional parameters,
         using a named argument in the call.
         You may write a suitable method yourself,
         or you may find
         that the methods from the <code>datetime.timedelta</code> class
         are helpful and can be used to fulfill this requirement. 
         </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    <h3>Output Format</h3>
    <p>
      As long as a run of your program contains at least one valid 
      data point, the output it sends to standard output should include the
      number of valid measurements
      included in the average, the average itself and whether it is
      for temperature, humidity or precipitation. For example you might print
      a message such as, "<code>There were 47 valid humidity measurements 
      during this period.  The average humidity is 88.478631.</code>"
      Your program's output will be read by human markers and not 
      an automated test program, so there is no specified output
      format to match. You also do not need to truncate or round-off the 
      averages that you calculate.
    </p>
    <h2> What to hand in</h2>
    <p>
      Commit to your repository the two files <code>regex.py</code>
      and <code>average_weather.py</code>. You may add test cases to
      the corresponding test programs; the tests will not be marked.
