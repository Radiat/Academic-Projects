This XHTML site gathers real estate data from a XML file and outputs it
to be compatible for viewing on a standards-compliant web browser such
as Firefox. 

The site simply requires an XML file that is valid with the accompaning
DTD. This XML file must be called 1a.xml, and must pass validation with
the DTD file, 1a.dtd. The XML file, if properly formatted under the DTD
is all the program needs. A XSL processor is required to transform both
1a.xml and 1a.xsl (the latter included by default) to produce two files:
price.html and distance.html. 

The index.html file must be opened for the data to display. There will be
two frames; the left as a navigation bar and the right for all real estate
data. Simply clicking on one of two links will display the real estate
data on the right frame. The information can currently be sorted by either
price or distance, in ascending form. The units are grouped by neighborhood.

Currently the scalability of the site rests upon the number of pictures in
one given entry, and the size of the pictures. For design purposes this
page was created with a small amount of listings in mind. Having 12,000
entries would probably make the page very sluggish to load if only for the
fact that some of those 12,000 may have pictures. Future versions would
implement a rather less eye-pleasing drop-box solution to handle multiple
pictures, which would pop-up in another window.

This site conforms to the specification to the letter, with not many extra
features enabled as of yet. The supplied CSS file makes the page very easy to
read, even though the visual quality is very suspect. Nevertheless the site was
made to be very lightweight with minimal bloat to support pictures.
