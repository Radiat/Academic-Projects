XML Validator README
--------------------

In this <a href=".">directory</a> you should see 7 files:

  - Readme (this file)
  - Validator.class
  - Validator.java
  - nest.xml
  - personnel.xml
  - personnel.dtd
  - xerces.jar

The two "personnel" files are provided as an example that you can validate and
change and revalidate in order to get a feel for how the Validator works.
The nest.xml example is provided to show how validation against an html
standard (in this case xhtml strict) is performed.

You will need to download the above files into a directory.  Note as before,
the jar file occupies a lot of space.  All the jar files are available in 
/student1/Courses/cscc09 on the fissure.utsc Unix system, so you can change your
class paths (examples below) accordingly to refer to /student1/Courses/cscc09/xerces.jar
for example rather than just xerces.jar in the local directory.

Compiling the Validator
-----------------------

The Validator is written in Java. If you haven't read the Java section in the
Student Guide and tried the Java examples you should do that first.

The Validator makes use of the SAX parser provided with Xerces (Apache's Java
based XML package). You'll need to have the xerces.jar file in your CLASSPATH
to be able to compile and run the example. For the purposes of this example,
you can either set the CLASSPATH environment variable to to reference the jar
file, or you can provide the full path to the xerces.jar file on the command
line to the Java compiler and VM. In this example I'll be providing the path on
the command line because that's the way you'll be doing it in your assignments.

I am assuming that you have copied all of the 7 files above into one directory.
To compile the Validator, issue the command:

  javac -classpath xerces.jar:. Validator.java

from the directory where you've copied the Validator.java and other
files. If the compile was successful you should now see a file named
Validator.class. You'll see a warning about a "deprecated API", ignore it.
I have provided file Validator.class in case you want to run the validator
on a system without a Java compiler installed.


Running the Validator
---------------------

Once you've got the Validator.class file you're ready to start validating! Type
the command:

  java -cp .:xerces.jar Validator

or

 java -cp .;xerces.jar Validator  (IF RUNNING ON WINDOWS.)

to print out the usage info. You should see a message describing the basic
syntax of the Validator. The message should look like:

  Usage: java -cp <classpath> Validator [-v] <XML document>

The required argument, <XML document>, is the name of the document you're going
to validate. The optional argument, -v, turns on verbose mode. When run in
verbose mode you'll see more information printed to the console while your XML
document is being validated. If verbose mode is used the Validator will report
violating line numbers, type of error, etc. If verbose mode is not used you
won't see anything printed to the terminal, but the return code can be accessed
by querying the $? variable (i.e. type "echo $?"). If the value of $? is 0 then
the XML document is valid w.r.t. its DTD.


An example
----------

Make sure the personnel.xml and personnel.dtd files are in the current directory
and type the command:

  java -cp .:xerces.jar Validator -v personnel.xml

You should see the following output:

  Validating personnel.xml...
  personnel.xml passed validation test.

Now, edit the personnel.xml file, removing the required <given>Big</given>
attribute from the person id="Big.Boss" element (line 6). then run the Validator
again. Now you should see something like:

  Validating personnel.xml...
  personnel.xml:6: org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The content of element
  type "name" is incomplete, it must match "((family,given)|(given,family))".

Error messages like these will help a great deal when debugging your
assignments.


Troubleshooting
---------------

- Is your CLASSPATH correct?
- Is the path to xerces.jar correct?
- Is java/javac in your search PATH?
- Did you copy the personnel files into your current directory?
- If you're running on Windows you'll have to make some adjustments to your
  CLASSPATH (Hint: replace ":" with ";" and "/" with "\").
